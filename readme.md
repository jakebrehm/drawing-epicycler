**Drawing Epicycler** is a program that visualizes the discrete fourier transform
of a user-drawn path.

# How to get it

To experience a live demo of this application, [click here](https://jakebrehm.com/epicycler/).

Alternatively, to get a copy of this script, use the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/jakebrehm/drawing-epicycler.git
```

# How to use it

After cloning the repository, open *index.html* in your favorite web browser. A blank black web page will appear.

Begin drawing by clicking and dragging anywhere on the canvas. As of right now, 
only continous drawings are supported; this means that you cannot click and drag 
more than once to make more complicated drawings.

Once you're finished with your drawing, release the mouse in order to start the 
visualization. Once the drawing has been fully drawn, it will start over from 
the beginning and loop infinitely until another drawing is made.

# Ideas for future changes
- Support discontinuous drawings
- Add more interactivity
